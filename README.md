# Astro Party II

### Brief Summary:
This is a recreation of the game Astro Party. I am not using it for commercial purpose, so please don't sue me.

### Development Log: (MM-DD-YYYY: "LOG")
* #### Yuxiang Huang:
    *  (08-26-2022): "Today I began the project by making a simple rectangular map and controls for the player ship, including rotatation and shooting."
    *  (08-27-2022): "Today I started by adding the ammo restraint for the ships. Each ship has at most three ammos and reload one every two seconds. In addition, I added the animation for how many ammo each ship has. After that, I changed the camera to orthographic and resize everything. Then I added laser beam to the game, including the first sound effect of the game. Next, I worked on the UI by having three chained screens. Lastly, I struggled with a bot and finally got it to work in the end of the day. Throughout the day, I also fixed a variety of issues I discovered while testing the game."
    *  (08-28-2022): "Today I made the minimum viable product for the ship screen. The player is able to choose at most four ships, making them player or bot. Then, I fixed their spawning positions and make bot attack the closest ship."
    *  (08-29-2022): Today I started by creating an end screen, which includes a rematch button and a back to ship screen button. Then, as I was going to write the code for displaying the winning message, I realized that it would be better to implement the team system first. Thus, I spent the rest of the morning working on the team system and resolving various issues that come with it. Later in the day, I spent an hour giving players the option to choose their prefered controls. Lastly, I fixed an issue by making the team button only appearing when player is on and optimize the text for the team numbers.
    *  (08-30-2022): Today I spent almost all my time working on the score board and finally got it to work.
    *  (08-31-2022): Today I started with displaying the winning message for the team mode. Then I added the solo mode where each player win points by killing other ships instead of being the last one alive. Also, I added features like team ships move together in the score board and better pictures. In addition, I fix issues in the score board and rematch button.
